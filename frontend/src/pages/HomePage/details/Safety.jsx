Our comprehensive safety measures cover every aspect of your ride, from the moment you book to when you reach your destination.

      <h3>1. Driver Verification and Training</h3>
      <p>
        All our drivers undergo a thorough verification process, including background checks and driving history reviews, to ensure that they meet our high standards. In addition to the background checks, every driver is required to complete a training program that covers safe driving practices, customer service, and emergency procedures. This ensures that they’re equipped to handle any situation with professionalism and care.

      <h3>2. Vehicle Safety Standards</h3>
      <p>
        Each vehicle in our fleet — from bikes to cars — is regularly inspected and maintained to meet strict safety standards. Our maintenance team ensures that every vehicle is roadworthy and safe to operate. From ensuring that bikes are in excellent working condition to verifying that cars have up-to-date insurance and safety features, we prioritize your safety above all else.

      <h3>5. Ride Ratings and Feedback</h3>

        After every ride, you have the opportunity to rate your driver and provide feedback. This helps us maintain a high standard of service and ensures that all drivers are accountable for their actions. If any concerns or issues arise during your ride, you can report them directly through the app, and we will investigate promptly.

Additionally, our cars are equipped with seat belts and other necessary safety measures to ensure you are always protected.
